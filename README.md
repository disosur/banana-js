# banana-js

### A very opinionated way on how I enjoy writing my backend Typescript applications

```bash
npx plant bananajs-tree
```

### The stack:

- Express
- Prisma
- Lucia Auth

## Commands

- Create Domain

```bash
npx grow bananajs {name of domain}
```

## Add a frontend with the power of HTMX and JSX (add vite)

this part is not a prio
