# banana-js

### A very opinionated way on how I enjoy writing my Node Typescript applications

```bash
npx bananajs-tree plant
```

### The stack:

- Express
- Prisma

## Commands

- Create Domain

```bash
npx bananajs grow {name of domain}
```

## Add a frontend with the power of HTMX and JSX (add vite)
